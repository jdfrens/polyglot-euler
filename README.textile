h1. Polyglot Euler

This repository contains my solutions to the problems found at Project
Euler (http://projecteuler.net/).

I've had several goals for this project:
  - multiple languages
  - rake management
  - automatic generation of code (when starting a new problem)

I blog about my solutions on "my blog":http://jdfrens.blogspot.com/search/label/project%20euler

h2. My System

My MacBook:
  - Mac OS X 10.5.6
  - 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
  - 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM

Software:
  - MacPorts version 1.7 (which provides the languages below)
  - Official Erlang version R13B
  - Glasgow Haskell Compiler version 6.10.4 (64-bit)
  - SWI-Prolog version 5.8.3
  - Official Python version 3.1.1
  - Official Ruby (MRI) version 1.8.7

h2. My Lib Folder

The lib folder contains libraries of helper functions that have been useful in
multiple problems. Sometime I handle the load path in my code, other times I
use a configuration file or environment variable.

h3. Prolog

In an <code>~/.plrc</code> file, I have this line:

pre. :- assert(library_directory('/Users/jdfrens/Projects/polyglot-euler/lib/prolog')).

Tweak the prefix up to the <code>/lib/prolog</code>.
